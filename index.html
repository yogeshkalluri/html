        <p>House Blends can often be described as reliable and straightforward – a blend that is a “go-to” in a coffee shop. They are generally seen as a consistent and high-value product that you can count on. The brew of a house blend coffee is different than that of a breakfast blend or espresso roast – meaning that when you pour a cup of a house blend coffee, you should expect to fall somewhere in the middle of a light roast and dark roast and have intermediate flavor. Here at Carta Coffee, our house blends are our Captain's Roast and Meridian Roast coffees. </p>

        <p>French roast coffee is a dark, robust type of roasted bean that will tantalize your taste buds. With its high-roast level, it produces an intense flavour without the bitterness or acidity found in most other light roasts. In fact, French roast has become so popular and desirable for its unique qualities that some refer to this blend as double-roasted. It may appear to be too robust for some, but numerous java connoisseurs discover it a delectable treat.</p>

        <p>Colombian coffee has a medium roast or a dark roast that is used to make rich espresso blends. Take note that coffee roast isn't related to the growth of coffee. Colombia is famous for its coffee beans which can be roasted to light or medium roast degrees</p>
